# odin-library

A simple library applet built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice with objects and code organization.

Clicking the add book button brings up a form to add a book's metadata.

When submit is clicked, values from the form are used to call the book constructor and the new book is added to the library array.

After the book is added to the library array, the array is iterated over and calls a create card function.

The cards display the books metadata and have a button to change the read status of the book, as well as a button to remove the book.
